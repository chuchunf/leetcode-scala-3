# HashMap

Hashmap is an associative array abstract data type, which maps keys to values. 
For scenarios that we don't need to loop through every item, rather just to check the existence, 
HashMap could effectively change the complexity **from loop O(n) to lookup O(1)**.

- Two sum: the expected value is known; 
- Repeating character: the character is known;
- Happy number: The list of unhappy number built along the way.

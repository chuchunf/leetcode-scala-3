# Breadth First Search
BFS is a traversing algorithm which starts from a selected node and traverse the graph layer-wise thus exploring the neighbour nodes (nodes which are directly connected to source node). 
Then move towards the next-level neighbour nodes. 
- A **queue** is used to enable the layer-wise traverse iteratively by keeping track of the child nodes that were encountered but not yet explored
- A recursive implementation could simply continue with the queue built at parent level

**Depth-first search** explores the node branch as far as possible,
may get lost in an infinite branch and never make it to the solution node.

### Usages
1. Find the **shortest path** in tree or graph
2. Cycle detection in undirected graph
3. Path finding

## Iteration
### 199. Binary Tree Right Side View
Given the root of a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.
```
Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5,null,4]
Output: [1,3,4]

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,null,3]
Output: [1,3]
```

### 133. Clone Graph
Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.
```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```
```
Example 1:
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).

### 130. Surrounded Regions => medium / iteration
https://github.com/chuchunf/leetcode-scala-3/blob/96edcbc70953e25ba3eedbcbaa7bf18b8034eff0/src/main/scala/bfs/SurroundedRegions.scala#L6-L26
Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
```
Example 1:
Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Explanation: Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
- It is on the border, or
- It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.
```

## Back Tracking
### 127. Word Ladder => hard / backtracking 
A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:

Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
sk == endWord
Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.
```
Example 1:
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.

Example 2:
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
```

#Recursion
Recursion solves problems where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem by using functions that call themselves from within their own code.
- Works with tree/linked list etc. recursive data structures 
- Recursion normally could be converted to Iteration via a Stack

Implement the recursion function 
- Identify recursion case => a problem could be resolved by re-apply same function
- Assume we already find the function then identify exit condition

#Back Tracking
Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons each partial candidate as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution, and resume from last good point (“backtracks”)
- Back tracking is a recursion with memorizing of past result (with a collection and indexes passing in recursive calls) 
- most of the problems that are discussed, can be solved using other known algorithms like Dynamic Programming or Greedy Algorithms in logarithmic

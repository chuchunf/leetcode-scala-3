# Number
* Make use of %10 and /10 

### Math tricks
  * Factorial Trailing Zeroes => count number of 5
  * Add digits => if dividable by 9 then 9 other reminder of divided by 9
  * Multiply Strings => virtual multiplication

### 9. Palindrome Number
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
```
Example 1:
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

Example 2:
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

### 7. Reverse Integer
Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).
```
Example 1:
Input: x = 123
Output: 321

Example 2:
Input: x = -123
Output: -321

Example 3:
Input: x = 120
Output: 21
```

### 43. Multiply Strings
Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.

Note: You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.
```
Example 1:
Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
Output: "6"

Example 2:
Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
Output: "56088"

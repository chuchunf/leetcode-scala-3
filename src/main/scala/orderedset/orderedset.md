# Ordered Set (Map)

A **set** can store **unique values, without any particular order**.

* Set is closely related to Map, the difference is **set is used to store only keys** while map is used to store key value pairs.
* Set is commonly **implemented the same way as Map**, in which the value of each key-value pair has a fixed value (like1)

An **ordered set** keeps the unique elements in sorted order. The time and space complexity depend on implementation

| Properties     | Hashmap             | TreeMap             | LinkedHashMap  |
|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Iteration      | No guaranteed order | sorted order        | insertion order |
| Get/Put/Remove | O(1)                | O(log(n))           | O(1)           |
| Nulls          | keys and values     | only values         | keys and values |
| Implementation | buckets             | red-black tree      | double linked buckets |
| Applications   | general purpose     | where order matters | LRU cache, etc. where insertion/access order matters |

## Get a key based on predefined order
OrderSet maintains a particular order, and provide functions such as **minBefore, maxAfter** to get a key (value pair) of given order in log(N) time.

### 729. My Calendar I
You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a double booking.

A double booking happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events.).

The event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that represents a booking on the half-open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.

Implement the MyCalendar class:

MyCalendar() Initializes the calendar object.
boolean book(int start, int end) Returns true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a double booking. Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.

```
Example 1:
Input
["MyCalendar", "book", "book", "book"]
[[], [10, 20], [15, 25], [20, 30]]
Output
[null, true, false, true]
```

### 731. My Calendar II
You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a triple booking.

A triple booking happens when three events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to all the three events.).

The event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that represents a booking on the half-open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.

Implement the MyCalendarTwo class:

MyCalendarTwo() Initializes the calendar object.
boolean book(int start, int end) Returns true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a triple booking. Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.
```
Example 1:
Input
["MyCalendarTwo", "book", "book", "book", "book", "book", "book"]
[[], [10, 20], [50, 60], [10, 40], [5, 15], [5, 10], [25, 55]]
Output
[null, true, true, true, false, true, true]
```

### 1818. Minimum Absolute Sum Difference
ou are given two positive integer arrays nums1 and nums2, both of length n.

The absolute sum difference of arrays nums1 and nums2 is defined as the sum of |nums1[i] - nums2[i]| for each 0 <= i < n (0-indexed).

You can replace at most one element of nums1 with any other element in nums1 to minimize the absolute sum difference.

Return the minimum absolute sum difference after replacing at most one element in the array nums1. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

|x| is defined as:

x if x >= 0, or
-x if x < 0.
```
Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,7,5], nums2 = [2,3,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are two possible optimal solutions:
- Replace the second element with the first: [1,7,5] => [1,1,5], or
- Replace the second element with the third: [1,7,5] => [1,5,5].
  Both will yield an absolute sum difference of |1-2| + (|1-3| or |5-3|) + |5-5| = 3.

Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [2,4,6,8,10], nums2 = [2,4,6,8,10]
Output: 0
Explanation: nums1 is equal to nums2 so no replacement is needed. This will result in an
absolute sum difference of 0.
```

## A compact ordered container
Instead of an array, OrderSet could be used to stored ordered data without spaces.

### 855. Exam Room
There is an exam room with n seats in a single row labeled from 0 to n - 1.

When a student enters the room, they must sit in the seat that maximizes the distance to the closest person. If there are multiple such seats, they sit in the seat with the lowest number. If no one is in the room, then the student sits at seat number 0.

Design a class that simulates the mentioned exam room.

Implement the ExamRoom class:

ExamRoom(int n) Initializes the object of the exam room with the number of the seats n.
int seat() Returns the label of the seat at which the next student will set.
void leave(int p) Indicates that the student sitting at seat p will leave the room. It is guaranteed that there will be a student sitting at seat p.
```
Example 1:

Input
["ExamRoom", "seat", "seat", "seat", "seat", "leave", "seat"]
[[10], [], [], [], [], [4], []]
Output
[null, 0, 9, 4, 2, null, 5]
```

### 732. My Calendar III
A k-booking happens when k events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., there is some time that is common to all k events.)

You are given some events [startTime, endTime), after each given event, return an integer k representing the maximum k-booking between all the previous events.

Implement the MyCalendarThree class:

MyCalendarThree() Initializes the object.
int book(int startTime, int endTime) Returns an integer k representing the largest integer such that there exists a k-booking in the calendar.
```
Example 1:
Input
["MyCalendarThree", "book", "book", "book", "book", "book", "book"]
[[], [10, 20], [50, 60], [10, 40], [5, 15], [5, 10], [25, 55]]
Output
[null, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3]
```
Use Order Map to simulate the time line to save space, as the time spot will be sparse.

# Greedy

A greedy algorithm is a simple, intuitive algorithm that is used in optimization problems. 
The algorithm makes the **optimal choice at each step** as it attempts to find the overall optimal way to solve the entire problem. 
However, in many problems, a greedy strategy does not produce an optimal solution, 
because it makes decisions based only on the information it has at any one step, without regard to the overall problem.

Only if both of the properties below are true, a greedy algorithm can be used to solve the problem.
- Greedy choice property: A global (overall) optimal solution can be reached by choosing the optimal choice at each step. 
- Optimal substructure: A problem has an optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the entire problem contains the optimal solutions to the sub-problems. => local optimal is global optimal 

In short, a greedy algorithm works **if and only if the optimal solution at each step is also the optimal solution as a whole**

If a Greedy Algorithm can solve a problem, then it generally becomes the best method to solve that problem as the Greedy algorithms are in general more efficient than other techniques like Dynamic Programming. 
But Greedy algorithms cannot always be applied. For example, the Fractional Knapsack problem can be solved using Greedy, but 0-1 Knapsack cannot be solved using Greedy.
An efficient solution is to use the Greedy approach. The basic idea of the greedy approach is to calculate the ratio value/weight for each item and sort the item on basis of this ratio. 
Then take the item with the highest ratio and add them until we canâ€™t add the next item as a whole and at the end add the next item as much as we can. Which will always be the optimal solution to this problem.

### 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.
```
Example 1:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

Example 2:
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.

### 134. Gas Station
There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique
```
Example 1:
Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.

### 179. Largest Number
Given a list of non-negative integers nums, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it.

Since the result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.
```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [10,2]
Output: "210"

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,30,34,5,9]
Output: "9534330"
```

### 44. Wildcard Matching
Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*' where:

* '?' Matches any single character.
* '*' Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).
```
Example 1:
Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".

Example 2:
Input: s = "aa", p = "*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' matches any sequence.
```

### 135. Candy
There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

* Each child must have at least one candy.
* Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.
```
Example 1:
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.

Example 2:
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

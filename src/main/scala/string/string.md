# String
A string is a sequence of characters, it has fixed length same as an array hence could be handled by algorithms such as two pointers, recursion and dynamic programming etc.

## Relative data structure
- **Trie**: a prefix tree, used for locating specific keys from a set,  
These keys are most often strings, with links between nodes defined not by the entire key, but by individual characters.

## General String Operations
### 14. Longest Common Prefix
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".
```
Example 1:
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"

Example 2:
Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
```

### 415. Add Strings
Given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2 as a string.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as BigInteger). You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.
```
Example 1:
Input: num1 = "11", num2 = "123"
Output: "134"

Example 2:
Input: num1 = "456", num2 = "77"
Output: "533"
```

### 67. Add Binary
Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string.
```
Example 1:
Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"

Example 2:
Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"
```
https://github.com/chuchunf/leetcode-scala-3/blob/96edcbc70953e25ba3eedbcbaa7bf18b8034eff0/src/main/scala/string/AddBinary.scala#L4-L11

### 38. Count and Say
The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(n) is the way you would "say" the digit string from countAndSay(n-1), which is then converted into a different digit string.
To determine how you "say" a digit string, split it into the minimal number of substrings such that each substring contains exactly one unique digit. Then for each substring, say the number of digits, then say the digit. Finally, concatenate every said digit.
```
Example 1:
Input: n = 1
Output: "1"
Explanation: This is the base case.

Example 2:
Input: n = 4
Output: "1211"
Explanation:
countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(2) = say "1" = one 1 = "11"
countAndSay(3) = say "11" = two 1's = "21"
countAndSay(4) = say "21" = one 2 + one 1 = "12" + "11" = "1211"
```

### 6. ZigZag Conversion
The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)
And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:
```
string convert(string s, int numRows);
```
```
Example 1:
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
Explanation:
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R

Example 2:
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
Explanation:
P     I    N
A   L S  I G
Y A   H R
P     I
```

### 165. Compare Version Numbers
Given two version numbers, version1 and version2, compare them.

Version numbers consist of one or more revisions joined by a dot '.'. Each revision consists of digits and may contain leading zeros. Every revision contains at least one character. Revisions are 0-indexed from left to right, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on. For example 2.5.33 and 0.1 are valid version numbers.

To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in left-to-right order. Revisions are compared using their integer value ignoring any leading zeros. This means that revisions 1 and 001 are considered equal. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then treat the revision as 0. For example, version 1.0 is less than version 1.1 because their revision 0s are the same, but their revision 1s are 0 and 1 respectively, and 0 < 1.

Return the following:

* If version1 < version2, return -1.
* If version1 > version2, return 1.
* Otherwise, return 0.
```
Example 1:
Input: version1 = "1.01", version2 = "1.001"
Output: 0
Explanation: Ignoring leading zeroes, both "01" and "001" represent the same integer "1".

Example 2:
Input: version1 = "1.0", version2 = "1.0.0"
Output: 0
Explanation: version1 does not specify revision 2, which means it is treated as "0".

Example 3:
Input: version1 = "0.1", version2 = "1.1"
Output: -1
Explanation: version1's revision 0 is "0", while version2's revision 0 is "1". 0 < 1, so version1 < version2.
```

## Other algorithms
### 763. Partition Labels
You are given a string s. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part.

Note that the partition is done so that after concatenating all the parts in order, the resultant string should be s.

Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.
```
Example 1:
Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.

Example 2:
Input: s = "eccbbbbdec"
Output: [10]
```
https://github.com/chuchunf/leetcode-scala-3/blob/96edcbc70953e25ba3eedbcbaa7bf18b8034eff0/src/main/scala/string/PartitionLabels.scala#L6-L19

### 161. One Edit Distance 
Given two strings s and t, determine if they are both one edit distance apart.

Note: There are 3 possiblities to satisify one edit distance apart:

Insert a character into s to get t
Delete a character from s to get t
Replace a character of s to get t
```
Example 1:
Input: s = "ab", t = "acb"
Output: true
Explanation: We can insert 'c' into s to get t.

Example 2:
Input: s = "cab", t = "ad"
Output: false
Explanation: We cannot get t from s by only one step.

Example 3:
Input: s = "1203", t = "1213"
Output: true
Explanation: We can replace '0' with '1' to get t.
```
https://github.com/chuchunf/leetcode-scala-3/blob/96edcbc70953e25ba3eedbcbaa7bf18b8034eff0/src/main/scala/string/OneEditDistance.scala#L4-L13

### 76. Minimum Window Substring
Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring
of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.
```
Example 1:
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.

Example 2:
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.

Example 3:
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
```

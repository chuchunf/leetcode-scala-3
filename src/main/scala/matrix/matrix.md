# Matrix
Matrix are 2 or more dimensional arrays, similar to a one-dimensional array, but it can be visualised as a grid (or table) with rows and columns.

### 54. Spiral Matrix
Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.
```
Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]

Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12]]
Output: [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]
```

### 36. Valid Sudoku
Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

* Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
* Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
* Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
```
Input: board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true
```

### 37. Sudoku Solver

### 48. Rotate Image
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.
```
Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]

Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]
Output: [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]
```

### 59. Spiral Matrix II
Given a positive integer n, generate an n x n matrix filled with elements from 1 to n2 in spiral order.
```
Example 1:
Input: n = 3
Output: [[1,2,3],[8,9,4],[7,6,5]]
```
https://github.com/chuchunf/leetcode-scala-3/blob/96edcbc70953e25ba3eedbcbaa7bf18b8034eff0/src/main/scala/matrix/SpiralMatrix2.scala#L4-L17

### 73. Set Matrix Zero
Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's.

You must do it in place.
```
Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]

Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[0,1,2,0],[3,4,5,2],[1,3,1,5]]
Output: [[0,0,0,0],[0,4,5,0],[0,3,1,0]]
```
Use first column and first row to store the zero column; 
and first column and first row need to be handled specially
https://github.com/chuchunf/leetcode-scala-3/blob/96edcbc70953e25ba3eedbcbaa7bf18b8034eff0/src/main/scala/matrix/SetMatrixZeroes.scala#L4-L16

### 74. Search a 2D Matrix
You are given an m x n integer matrix matrix with the following two properties:

Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
Given an integer target, return true if target is in matrix or false otherwise.

You must write a solution in O(log(m * n)) time complexity.
```
Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
Output: false
```
